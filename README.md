Hello everyone. My name is Ravi and I am from Malaysia. I am a food enthusiast and I enjoy relaxing and chilling with friends. I also love playing sports and I dream to play in the Olympics one day. I am currently on an exchange programme in Eindhoven University of Technology. I have travelled to Amsterdam, Antwerp and Paris thus far.
